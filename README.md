# JS-Bookmarking-App

1. Created an input box that grows and shrinks by applying a CSS styling to a class that gets added.

2. Added form element and classes to take input of text box and create an a element. adjusted z index to make overlay cover the bookmarks while enterting one. Turned off pointed events while overlay is not showing

3. Stored the bookmark data in local storage and brought it back
   Rewrote the function to allow the data to be stored in an Array. Had to Json.Stringify the data to store it, and JSON.parse to bring it back.

4. Learned how to remove data from local storage. How to use a click on sepecific area to do specific action.

5. Fetched data using an API for bookmarking websites
   I dont like how now it doesnt take just random text, and for it to accept the pull it has to be the exact link, including https

Retrospective

Some issues I had were with simple syntax errors, and mispellings causing the complicated systems to fail.

The video over all was good, though I feel like we left the website in a usable but impractical state.

A more updated video would be good, that uses tech from at most a year or so out of date.
