# JS-Bookmarking-App

1. Created an input box that grows and shrinks by applying a CSS styling to a class that gets added.

2. Added form element and classes to take input of text box and create an a element. adjusted z index to make overlay cover the bookmarks while enterting one. Turned off pointed events while overlay is not showing

3. Stored the bookmark data in local storage and brought it back
   Rewrote the function to allow the data to be stored in an Array. Had to Json.Stringify the data to store it, and JSON.parse to bring it back.
